# Daily Python Practice

This will be my daily coding practice for python, as my new years' resolution I will dedicate time to finish python problems daily even if it takes me the whole day to understand.

## Purpose
- From the name itself, my purpose is to build a habit of programming daily without relying on A.I to magicallyâœ¨ do my problems
- I will also build a positive relationship with A.I by utilizing them as a tutor only, and nothing more than just a guide.
- Improve problem-solving skills in Python.
- Track my **progress**
